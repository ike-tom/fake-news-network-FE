# Fake News Network - CodersCamp 2021/22 Hackathon Hack-a-Troll
## I. Team

The base of the project was created during 24h Hackathon Hack-a-Troll in Wrocław. The team worked as part of the [CodersCamp](https://coderscamp.pl/) course. The application was made by the course participants with the help of a mentor.

**After Hackathon, I added new functionalities such as game modes, improved best scores and cleaned up the code - [Tomasz Ikert](https://github.com/ike-tom)**
